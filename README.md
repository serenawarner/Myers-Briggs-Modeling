## Myers-Briggs Type Indicator Prediction using Jungian Cognitive Functions and Text Input

My Junior I.S. is using SVMs and logistic regression to create prediction models for the MBTI using text input and cognitive function classes, first introduced by John Beebe.

The data for this project is too large to upload onto the repository, however, the data originates from 

https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/zeyadkhalid/mbti-personality-types-500-dataset?resource=download&select=MBTI+500.csv

I used the types for each post to create 6 classifications: rational functions, "rationals" (binary); irrational functions, "irrationals" (binary); dominant rational functions, "rat_dominant" (4 classes); dominant irrational functions, "irrat_dominant" (4 classes); dominant functions, "dominant" (8 classes); and auxiliary functions, "auxilary" (8 classes). Here's how they're broken down for each type:
